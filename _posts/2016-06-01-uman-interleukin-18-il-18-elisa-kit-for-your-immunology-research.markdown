IL-18 is a cytokine that belongs to the IL-1 superfamily and is produced by macrophages and other cells. IL-18 works by binding to the interleukin-18 receptor, and together with IL-12 it induces cell-mediated immunity following infection with microbial products like lipopolysaccharide (LPS). After stimulation with IL-18, natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells release another important cytokine called interferon-γ (IFN-γ) or type II interferon that plays an important role in activating the macrophages or other cells.

The combination of this cytokine and IL12 has been shown to inhibit IL-4 dependent IgE and IgG1 production, and enhance IgG2a production in B cells. IL-18 binding protein (IL18BP) can specifically interact with this cytokine, and thus negatively regulate its biological activity.

Endometrial IL-18 receptor mRNA and the ratio of IL-18 binding protein to interleukin 18 are significantly increased in adenomyosis patients in comparison to normal people, indicating a role in its pathogenesis. In addition, IL-18 is a able to induce severe inflammatory reactions, which suggests its role in certain inflammatory disorders. has also been found to increase the Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-beta production in human neuron cells.

What’s more, to determine the intravitreous levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and to ascertain their association with PDR activity in 2014, the related research was conducted. It turned out both intravitreous IL-18 and VEGF were elevated in patients with PDR, which were closely correlated in active PDR. IL-18 may contribute to retinal angiogenesis by acting together with or via VEGF, and become the potential therapeutic target for treatment of PDR.
